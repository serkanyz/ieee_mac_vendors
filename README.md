This Python code retrieves a list of MAC address prefixes (OUI) along with their associated manufacturer names from the IEEE website. It uses the requests library to download the OUI file from IEEE's publicly accessible standards site, parsing the downloaded text to build a list of MAC prefixes and corresponding manufacturers.

How It Works:
HTTP Request: The code sends an HTTP GET request to download the OUI list from IEEE.
Parsing the Data: After confirming a successful download, the code processes the data line-by-line. For each line containing “(hex)” (indicating the MAC address prefix), it extracts the MAC prefix (OUI) and manufacturer name.
Building the List: Each MAC prefix and its associated manufacturer are appended to a list called IEEEMac.
Output: Finally, the code outputs this list, providing an easy-to-access structure of MAC address vendors.
The code is useful for those needing to map MAC addresses to manufacturers, such as network administrators or cybersecurity analysts, to identify device origins on a network.
